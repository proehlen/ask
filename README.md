This is a gui dialog prompt tool for incorporating user decisions in scripts run from a desktop environment.

**WARNING**
This is a throwaway project created because:
1. Zenity stopped working for me after a recent update,
2. I'm learning Dart/Flutter and it's trivial to build myself a replacement.

If you need this sort of functionality yourself, seek out mature and better supported alternatives such as:
* zenity
* dialog
* whiptail, etc
